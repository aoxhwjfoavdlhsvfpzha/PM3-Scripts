# PM3-Scripts
PM3 installation scripts for automating as much of the process as I could manage, wanted to post them somewhere a bit easier to look at.

For the full install wizard, visit: https://siliconbased.us/pm3/install/

Scripts have been tested and seem to be working, but use of scripts is ***at your own risk***!

I am not a good scripter, appologies to anyone who knows what they're doing who looks at my code :)
